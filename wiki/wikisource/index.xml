   jfxConverter is a Java library prodiving utilities to convert a JavaFX Scene to Swing Graphics2D orders. 
   It is then simple to use it to convert to any format which takes a Graphics2D as input. The project comes with
   PowerPoint and a SVG converters.
   
   <title title="the problem" />
   It is relatively simple to draw any Swing content in various formats. Each The <code>JComponent</code> has
   a <javadoc path="javax.swing.JComponent" member="paint(java.awt.Graphics)" /> method which allows to draw the component in
   any <code>Graphics</code> context, and many Java libraries dealing with various graphics formats have classes which allow to
   create files of their respective format by emitting <javadoc path="java.awt.Graphics2D" /> drawing orders.

   There is not similar capabilities in the JavaFX framework. Therefore converting JavaFX Scene content to graphics formats is
   not an easy task.
   
   <title title="the solution" />
   jfxConverter allows to walk through the JavaFX Scene tree and emit <javadoc path="java.awt.Graphics2D" /> drawing orders, 
   therefore the same libraries which can be used with Swing to create files of various graphic formats can also be used with 
   JavaFX. The library comes with both a PowerPoint and an SVG driver, but creating other drivers for other graphic formats is possible.

   It is possible to test the usage of the converter with a script setting the Node structure.
