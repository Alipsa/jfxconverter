  What is it?

  MDIutilities is a Java library prodiving various utility classes, mainly useful
  in Swing or JavaFX development 

  Where is it?
  ------------

  The home page for the MDIUtilities project can be found in the sourceforge Project web site
  (http://java.net/projects/MDIUtilities). There you also find 
  information on how to download the latest release as well as all the other 
  information you might need regarding this project.

  History
  -------
  This project is a copy of the java.net project of the same name (http://java.net/projects/MDIUtilities). 
  I own the two projects, and I ported the java.net project infrastructure to sourceforge because java.net hosting 
  infrastructure will close soon (April 2017).

  The associated java.net project exists since 2006.

  Requirements
  ------------

  A Java 1.8 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.

  Installation
  ------------

  The MDIUtilities.jar file is the library of the application.

  Licensing and legal issues
  --------------------------

The MDIUtilities Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. 

MDIUtilities comes in two different packages:

== MDIUtilities-APACHE ==
MDIUtilities-APACHE is distributed under * BOTH * the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 
and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.
To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:
MDIUtilities is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 
	*or*
the Apache License, Version 2.0

== MDIUtilities-LGPL ==
MDIUtilities-LGPL is distributed * ONLY * under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
The only differences between the two distributions is that the MDIUtilities-LGPL source code 
contain the org.mdiutil.prefs.XMLParser class that borrow code from Oracle's OpenJDK code.

As the two licenses allow you to use the binary code in non open-source projects,
the only real difference for you is if you want to modify the source code of these classes, you
* MUST * use the MDIUtilities-APACHE distribution.

However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL 
license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
of the MDIUtilites source code provides open and free access to the technology both
for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the
GPL.

You can freely modify, extend, and improve the MDIUtilities source code. The only
question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license
used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or
added features.

Note that the org.mdiutil.swing.autocomplete package comes with a BSD license.
