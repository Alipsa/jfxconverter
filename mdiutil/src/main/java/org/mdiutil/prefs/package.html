  This package contains an implementation of the java preferences classes,
  allowing to use these preferences in a network. These preferences have the following properties:
  <ul>
  <li>the user preferences are serialized in an xml file, under a directory specific of the application</li>
  <li>the system preferences are serialized in an xml file</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ensures that the preferences will follow the "nomad" user.</p> 
  <p>FIXED : It was necessary to perfom a more thoroughly modification than expected in
  the package, because the java.util.prefs package does create "java" Preferences by default  
  when an XML tree is imported, or nodes added, which result in the creation of a node in the 
  default java backing store.</p>
 <p>For example, in Windows, the backing store is the Windows registry, which is modified even
 if a custom PreferencesFactory is used.</p>
