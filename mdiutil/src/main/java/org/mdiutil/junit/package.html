     A package for managing JUnit Tests. This package allows to:
     <UL>
        <LI>Order Unit Tests methods runs (by default an beginning with Java 7 the order of runs of Unit tests methods
           is not consistent with the order on which the methods are defined in the source file. This is because methods 
           in the associated .class file can be reordered for performance reasons (keep in mind than the JVM specification never
           specified that the order of methods in the source file should be kepyt in the .class file).
           A {@link org.mdiutil.junit.Order} annotation on methods allows to run the methods on a specified order</LI>
        <li>Categories Unit Tests classes, and allow to configure which categories will be run</LI>
