/**
 * A JUnit runner which allows to control the ordering of tests in a test class, in the context of a JavaFX
 * Application.
 *
 * <h1>Tests Ordering</h1>
 * For Java &le; 6.0, the Oracle JVM execute the tests methods in the test class in the order they are declared
 * in the source. It is not the case anymore for Java &ge; 7.0, in this case it is not possible to rely on the
 * JVM for the execution in the test methods, creating specific test failures on Java 7 which would work
 * well for Java 6. The solution is to use a custom Test Runner where the ordering of test methods is defined
 * through an annotation.
 *
 * In many cases, the ordering of tests cases is not imporetant, but in some specific
 * cases the state at the start of the next test case depends on tyhe state at the end of the previous one.
 * The OrderedRunner class is a Test runner which will order the test methods according to the
 * value of the &#064;Order annotation.
 *
 * <h1>Example</h1>
 * If a test class has the two following methods:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyTest {
 *
 *   &#064;Test
 *   public void test1() {
 *   ...
 *   }
 *
 *   &#064;Test
 *   public void test2() {
 *   ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * nothing prevents the tests to be executed in the order test2() <b>then</b> test1(). To ensure that
 * the order will be test1() <b>then</b> test2(), you can use:
 * <pre>
 * &#064;RunWith(OrderedRunner.class)
 * public class MyTest {
 *
 *   &#064;Test
 *   &#064;Order(order=1)
 *   public void test1() {
 *   ...
 *   }
 *
 *   &#064;Test
 *   &#064;Order(order=2)
 *   public void test2() {
 *   ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @version 0.9.12
