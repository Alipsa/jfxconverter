  This package provides several utility geometry classes. It contains :
  <UL>
  <LI>a Polygon2D class, using float coordinates instead of the int coordinates
  of the java Polygon class, but having the same characteristics</LI>
  <LI>a Polyline2D class, allowing to defined a polyline without having to
  define a set of separate lines</LI>
  <LI>a Vector2D class, containing many methods useful to perform 2D Vector
  calculations</LI>
  <LI>a ShapeNormalizer class, allowing to convert Shapes to a set of Arcs,
  Polygons, and Lines </LI>
  <LI>a GeometryRuler class, allowing to calculate the area and length of
Shapes</LI>
  <LI>a ClippableShape class, allowing to perform a intersect method on a shape
  which is not an Area</LI>
